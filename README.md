### I keep my personal site updated at [kohzy.com](https://www.kohzy.com) - it's where I keep things including past projects, research interests, design and translation work.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an interactive map of the 8th century Tang poet Li Bai. See my `libai-map` repo.
- 🤝 I’m very interested in how I can apply my skills to help the fight against climate change. Please reach out if you are looking for collaborators and think I can be useful in any way.
