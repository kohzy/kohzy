### I keep my personal site updated at [kohzy.com](https://www.kohzy.com) - it's where I keep things including past projects, research interests, design and translation work.

Building:
- 🖌️ Am currently working on an art project that blends mythology with decarbonization
- 🌏 Contributed to [CDR.fyi](https://github.com/cdr-marketwatch) - our open database helps the carbon dioxide removal market grow.
- 🏗️ Was working on an interactive map of the 8th century Tang poet Li Bai. This is set up as a digital supplement to Ha Jin's excellent book _The Banished Immortal_. See my `libai-map` repo.
