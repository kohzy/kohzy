- 🌏 Actively contributing to [CDR.fyi](https://github.com/cdr-marketwatch) - our open database helps the carbon dioxide removal market grow.
- 🏗️ I’m currently working on an interactive map of the 8th century Tang poet Li Bai. This is set up as a digital supplement to Ha Jin's excellent book _The Banished Immortal_. See my `libai-map` repo.
